            <h2>What you need</h2>
            <p>
                To use the calculator, you will need to know you:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>height</li>
                <li>weight</li>
            </ul>

            <br />
            <h2>Ethnic background</h2>
            <p>
                The calculator will also ask for information on your ethnic background.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is because people from an Asian, Black African, African-Caribbean or Middle Eastern ethnic background have a higher chance of developing health problems at a lower BMI.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you enter information on your ethnic background, the calculator will give you more accurate advice about your BMI result.
            </p>

            <br />
            <h2>Your results</h2>
            <p>
            Your BMI result will be displayed as a number with one of these weight categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>underweight</li>
                <li>a healthy weight</li>
                <li>overweight</li>
                <li>obese</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After getting your result, you may be asked to measure your waist. This can help you understand if you are carrying too much weight around your tummy.
            </p>

                            <p>The BMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.</p>
                            <p>For example, if you weigh 70kg (around 11 stone) and are 1.73m (around 5 foot 8 inches) tall, you work out your BMI by:</p>
                            <p>squaring your height in metres: 1.73 x 1.73 = 2.99</p>
                            <p>dividing your weight in kilograms: 70 รท 2.99 = 23.41</p>
                            <p>Your result will be displayed to one decimal place, for example, 23.4.</p>

            <h2>What your results mean</h2>
            <p>
                A higher BMI increases the chance of developing long-term conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
            </p>
            <p>
                The BMI calculation is just one measure of health. It cannot tell the difference between muscle and fat.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you have a lot of muscle, you may be classed as overweight or obese despite having low body fat.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why you may get a better idea of your overall health from measuring your waist.
